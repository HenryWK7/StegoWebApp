                    Image Steganography is a technique used to hide secret data within an image file, such that 
                    the data is concealed in a way that it is not easily detectable by the human eye. This is 
                    accomplished by embedding hidden information into the image’s pixels without significantly 
                    altering the visual appearance of the image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In image steganography, the most common method is to modify the least significant bits (LSB) 
                    of the pixel values. In a typical image, each pixel has color values (usually in RGB format: 
                    Red, Green, Blue), which are represented by numbers. These numbers are often stored in 8 bits,
                     meaning there are 256 possible values for each color channel. The LSBs of these values are altered 
                     slightly to store hidden data, such as text, another image, or any other form of binary information.
                </p>
                <h2>How it works:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Data Embedding:</b> The secret message is first converted into binary form (a sequence of 0s and 1s). 
                        These bits are then embedded into the LSBs of the image's pixel color values. Because the least 
                        significant bit only contributes slightly to the pixel’s color, the changes made by embedding the 
                        data are usually imperceptible to the human eye.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Data Extraction:</b> To retrieve the hidden data, the receiver needs to extract the LSBs from the image 
                        and reconstruct the original message from those bits.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Secure Communication:</b> It is used to secretly transmit sensitive data, ensuring privacy and security.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Digital Watermarking:</b> Embedding watermarks into images to assert copyright or ownership.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Covert data storage:</b> Hiding information within images to avoid detection, 
                        especially in sensitive or censored environments.

                <p>I developed this site to showcase a basic implementation of image steganography. This is a
                    client-side application so none of the images or files selected will be uploaded to a server online. 
                    All the code runs natively on the browser. Everything will be cleared when the browser tab is closed.
                </p>
                <p>This is just a fun site for messing around with hiding secret messages or files inside images. Fair disclaimer: 
                    If you want to use this to send the image over web through other applications then I can't guarentee that the
                    integrity of your secret message or file will be preserved. Some platforms like Facebook or Instagram for example 
                    might do things like image compression, format conversions, resizing, etc. which could affect the encoded image.
